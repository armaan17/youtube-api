$Youtube API Demo

This simple website created using html (featuring boostrap elements) and javascript allows the user to search for a topic, and enter the amount of videos they would like to see.
When "search" is clicked, relevant videos based off youtube's search algorithm will appear, and under that the description for that specific video will appear.
